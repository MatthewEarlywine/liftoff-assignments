# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
For our Secret Restaurant review app, the restaurant owner (the client) submits tickets for reviews. 
The users then complete selected reviews, then submit the completed reviews back to the app for the client to
review the results. As a possible stretch, an automated ticked could then be submitted directly to the owner, rather than having 
them log back in to the app.

The main usefulness of the app comes in streamlining the process by which users complete the review process and get 
the results back to the clients. The idea behind this came from a side project a co-developer was working on for
the ticketing system, and we came up with a practical, real-world means of using it.

### Features
Log-in: The log-in system will have three levels of user authentication (clients, reviewers, and admins), each with its own
access rights.

Review: Initially, this will involve a series of one-to-five star ratings for various aspects of the restaurant 
experience, but there will be room for more in-depth analysis in later iterations.

Ticket: The ticketing system is an automated means of organizing tasks to be completed (in this case, restaurants
to be reviewed).

Map integration: This element will ensure reviewers will be able to find the restaurants to critique.
